# information
Hello! This macro is made by beez as some others (see credits in the credits button), Currently it is still under developement and is not fully functional, so if u decided it use it then thank you for your support, but please do not expect it to be perfect. Im trying my best to make it as good as possible and i spend 5 hours daily on it so i am working on it as much as i can. Please do not ask me if its safe to use or not, it is safe to use, im trying to make a program and don't like it when i do so much work on it and everyone is just like "is it safe to use?" and "are u trying to steal my account". The macro has nothing to do with logging into accounts. Here are what a port is before u ask if its gonna steal your account, feel free to look it up if u don't trust me:

Port: A port in networking is a software-defined number associated to a network protocol that receives or transmits communication for a specific service. This is used to connect multiple accounts together over wifi.

I made this make to add things natro refuses to add, or just has not yet. I am not a expert programmer and im still in classes, so if you have any suggestions or want to help me make this better, feel free to contact me on discord.

This macro should be ran with the **lowest** roblox graphic settings for the best experience.

**performance stats** settings should also be turned **OFF** if you have it enabled

## Guide to using the macros extra settings

1. **Vic hop**

The vic hop toggle can be clicked on, this will make the macro automatically hop to random servers looking for a vic bee. If you want to use alts then select which type of alt it is in the accounts tab. **DOES NOT WORK CURRENTLY WITH ALTS.**

2. **Gather**

In this tab you can pick a field to gahter from. The macro will gather from that field until the time limit is reached. Not every feild has been added yet.

3. **Beesmas tools**

If you toggle a beesmas tool on, the macro will use that tool when the cooldown reaches 0 or less.

4. **Boosting tools and stats**

In this tab you can use tools to help u boost, such automatilcly pressing keys. You can also click the "display stats" button to see your stats when boosting. This is not fully implemented yet.
